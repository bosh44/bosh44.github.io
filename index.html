 <p id="new"><b>12/08/17 00:20 :</b> Just added a small bash script game, available in the nav bar. This was a part of a course I took on Coursera. On run in will ask you to make a guess of the number of files the the current directory. You may check it out. Stupied little program... Curently working on getting new skills for more projects that I hope will be much more impressive.</p>
 <p id="second"><b>11/25/17 11:15 :</b> Right now this site is builed in the way of JUSTGETITINWORK with place holders and without real content. I am still trying to figure how I want it to look and feel. later on when I'll have actual stuf to post this site will be much more pulished and hopefuly impresive. Might also crrect my spelling and grammer later on. </p>
